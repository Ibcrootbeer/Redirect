# Redirect
 
Redirect is a [Dalamud](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud) plugin for Final Fantasy XIV Online. 

The plugin enables seamless use of mouseover and focus target functionality by allowing you to change the base targeting priority of each action on your bars.

### TODO

- [x] Actually write a README
- [x] Fix action filtering (better than initial expectations, thanks XIVClientStructs devs)
- [x] Fringe ability support QA (Kinda... I blacklisted some spooky stuff)
- [x] Sanity check on redirection count
- [ ] Implement placed actions correctly - the vectors seems to be rabid. standing by
- [ ] Extended runtime tests/stability check
